# Ngspice Simulations for Several Circuits in *The Art of Electronics, 3rd ed.*


## Overview

This is an ongoing project to have full simulations for most circuit diagrams in *The Art of Electronics, 3rd ed.* by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill. All simulations are done using [\[Ngspice\]](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/) with [\[Kicad\]](https://www.kicad.org/) as the Designer.
